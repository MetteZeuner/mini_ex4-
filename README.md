<h3>Description<h3> 

<h6>Because I was under a bit of time pressure this week, the idea for this program isn’t very original – I borrowed the initial concept from one of Daniel Schiffman’s videos (the one where he makes a ball which does the exact same thing) and then I added the functions of the ball being able to change color and direction when you click the mouse. The idea is that the ball bouncing from wall to wall is supposed to demonstrate the loop. The changing of the direction is probably what demonstrates the feedback most successfully in my program, because it affects the way the ball bounces from wall to wall, not stopping it, just changing the course.<h6>
